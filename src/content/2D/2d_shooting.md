## Problem

You want to shoot projectiles from your player/mob/etc..

## Solution

### Setting up the bullet

First, we'll set up a "bullet" object that we can instance. Here are the nodes we'll use:

```
{{< gd-icon Area2D >}} Area2D: Bullet
    {{< gd-icon Sprite2D >}} Sprite
    {{< gd-icon CollisionShape2D >}} CollisionShape2D
```

For the {{< gd-icon Sprite2D >}}`Sprite`'s texture, you can use any image you like. Here's an example one:

Set up the nodes and configure the sprite and collision shape. If your texture is oriented pointing up, like the one above, make sure to rotate the {{< gd-icon Sprite2D >}}`Sprite` node by `90°` so that it's pointing to the right, ensuring it matches the parent’s “forward” direction.

Add a script and connect the {{< gd-icon Area2D >}}`Area2D`'s `body_entered` signal.

```gdscript
extends Area2D

var speed = 750

func _physics_process(delta):
    position += transform.x * speed * delta

func _on_Bullet_body_entered(body):
    if body.is_in_group("mobs"):
        body.queue_free()
    queue_free()
```

For this example, we'll remove the bullet if it hits anything at all. We'll also delete anything tagged in the "mobs" group that it hits.

### Shooting

We need to set up a spawn location for the bullets. Add a {{< gd-icon Position2D >}}`Position2D` and place it where you want the bullets to spawn. Here's an example, placed at the barrel of the gun. I've named it "Muzzle".

Notice that as the  player rotates, the Muzzle's `transform` remains oriented the same way relative to the gun. This will be very convenient when spawning the bullets, as they can use the transform to get the proper position *and* direction. We just set the new bullet's `transform` equal to the muzzle's.

This will work for any character type, not just the "rotate-and-move" style shown here. Just attach the {{< gd-icon Position2D >}}`Position2D` where you want the bullets to spawn.

In the character's script we add a variable to hold the bullet scene for instancing:

```gdscript
export (PackedScene) var Bullet = preload("res://2DExample/Bullet.tscn")
```

And check for our defined input action:

```gdscript
    if Input.is_action_just_pressed("shoot"):
        shoot()
```

Now in our `shoot()` function we can instance a bullet and add it to the tree. A common mistake is to add the bullet as a child of the player:

```gdscript
func shoot():
    var b = Bullet.instance()
    add_child(b)
    b.transform = $Muzzle.transform
```

The problem here is that since the bullets are children of the player, they are affected when the player moves or rotates.

To fix this, we should make sure the bullets are added to the world instead. In this case, we'll use `owner`, which refers to the root node of the scene the player is in. Note that we also need to use the muzzle's *global* transform, or else the bullet would not be where we expected.

```gdscript
func shoot():
    var b = Bullet.instance()
    owner.add_child(b)
    b.transform = $Muzzle.global_transform
```
